"""This module defines the WarmStartShiftPreviousSolution class.

The next warm start is generated based only on the previous solution. It
shifts the previous solution by the amount of the first time step.
- It supports non-constant time steps.
- It assumes the actuation model and the dynamics is the same all along the
  trajectory. To overcome this issue, it would need to take the models from
  the OCP.

When there is no previous solution, the warm start is calculated using an internal
WarmStartReference object.
